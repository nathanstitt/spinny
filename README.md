# spinny
An very old attempt at a networked linked music player

Has a c++ backend coupled to a ActionScript ui. (*good tech choice there!*)

The basic idea was that the backend would stream an mp3 to multiple front ends, while keeping them all in sync.  

Basically Sonos completely stole this idea from me :P
